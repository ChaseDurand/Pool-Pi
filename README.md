Pool-Pi is a system for interfacing with Goldline/Hayward Aqualogic pool control boards over WiFi via a Raspberry Pi. It adds wireless capabilities to non-wireless control boards and a web interface for viewing updates and sending commands. The web interface emulates a local display, allowing for the same controls accessible from the physical unit.
